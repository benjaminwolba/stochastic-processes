  abstract = {IT is a well-known fact that when a sinusoidal E.M.F. (of the form E0 sin wt) is available, it is a relatively simple matter to design an electrical system such that alternating currents or potential differences will occur in the system, having a frequency which is a whole multiple of the applied E.M.F., e.g. 2w, 3w, etc. For example, when the E.M.F. E0, sin wt is applied to a diode-rectifier, the current in the anode circuit will include a component of double frequency, i.e. 2w. This is therefore one method of frequency multiplication. Several other methods could easily be mentioned.},

  abstract               = {Many biochemical processes, such as charge hopping or protein folding, can be described by an average timescale to reach a final state, starting from an initial state. Here, we provide a pedagogical treatment of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) of a physical process, which depends on the number of intervening states between the initial state and the target state. Our aim in this tutorial review is to provide a clear development of the mean first-passage time formalism and to show some of its practical utility. The MFPT treatment can provide a useful link between microscopic rates and the average timescales often probed by experiment.},
