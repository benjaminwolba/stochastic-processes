(of the form E0 sin wt) is available, it is a relatively simple matter to design an electrical system such that alternating currents or potential differences will occur in the system, having a frequency which is a whole multiple of the applied E.M.F., e.g. 2w, 3w, etc. For example, when the E.M.F. E0, sin wt is applied to a diode-rectifier, the current in the anode circuit will include a component of double frequency, i.e. 2w. This is therefore one method of frequency multiplication. Several other methods could easily be mentioned.},

A single crystal of Ba2CoGe2O7 was grown and its magnetization was measured. A weak ferromagnetism was observed at 6.7K, while the spiral antiferromagnetism was reported in Ba2CuGe2O7. The origin of the ordered states in these isostructural materials are Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the change of the direction of D vector results in the different spin configurations. We have also synthesized polycrystalline samples of Ba2Cu1−xCoxGe2O7, and observed the change of the ordered state with x.},

  abstract = {Magnetism and ferroelectricity are essential to many forms of current technology, and the quest for multiferroic materials, where these two phenomena are intimately coupled, is of great technological and fundamental importance. Ferroelectricity and magnetism tend to be mutually exclusive and interact weakly with each other when they coexist. The exciting new development is the discovery that even a weak magnetoelectric interaction can lead to spectacular cross-coupling effects when it induces electric polarization in a magnetically ordered state. Such magnetic ferroelectricity, showing an unprecedented sensitivity to ap plied magnetic fields, occurs in 'frustrated magnets' with competing interactions between spins and complex magnetic orders. We summarize key experimental findings and the current theoretical understanding of these phenomena, which have great potential for tuneable multifunctional devices.},

  abstract = {Magnetic vortices can be stabilized in magnetic materials by a so-called Dzyaloshinsky interaction. Their structure is calculated systematically for uniaxial ferromagnetic materials of the easy-axis type by numerically solving the differential equations in the circular cell approximation. In reduced units two external parameters are left over: the value of an external field parallel to the crystal axis and the relative strength of the Dzyaloshinsky interaction. A phase diagram in these variables consists of three thermodynamically stable phases: a uniform state at high field values, a one-dimensionally modulated spiral state at low fields and the new vortex state in an intermediate field range. The corresponding calculated magnetization curves clearly show the transitions between these states.},

  abstract = {A long-standing problem in modern physics is the description of particle-wave duality in terms of countable particles in continuous fields. It is known that particle-like states called skyrmions (they were conceived by Tony Skyrme) are a characteristic of nonlinear field models on microscopic to cosmological scales. But to date it has only been established that skyrmions exist as excitations, or when stabilized by external fields or topological defects, where they manifest as Turing patterns, spin textures in quantum Hall magnets, or blue phases in liquid crystals. New theoretical work suggests that skyrmions can also form stable ground states in various types of magnetic metals that should be observable directly with modern magnetic microscopy techniques. And on this new theory, skyrmion ground states should exist generally in a large number of materials.},

An incommensurate magnetic spiral structure with the propagation vector (1 + ξ,ξ,0) (ξ = 0.027) was observed below TN = 3.26 K. The spin dynamics can be adequately described by conventional spin-wave theory with two exchange constants: nearest-neighbor in-plane antiferromagnetic coupling J1 ≈ 0.48 meV and interplane ferromagnetic interaction J3 ≈ 0.013 meV. This set of exchange parameters apparently fails to explain the spiral order. The non-centrosymmetric crystal structure suggests that the incommensurate phase may be the result of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya instability of the Neel ground state.},

On a fundamental level, skyrmions are model systems for topologically protected spin textures and can be considered as the counterpart of topologically protected electronic states, emphasizing the role of topology in the classification of complex states of condensed matter. Recent impressive demonstrations of the control of individual nanometre-scale skyrmions -- including their creation, detection, manipulation and deletion -- have raised expectations for their use in future spintronic devices, including magnetic memories and logic gates. From a materials perspective, it is remarkable that skyrmions can be stabilized in ultrathin transition metal films, such as iron -- one of the most abundant elements on earth -- if in contact with materials that exhibit high spin-orbit coupling. At present, research in this field is focused on the development of transition-metal-based magnetic multilayer structures that support skyrmionic states at room temperature and allow for the precise control of skyrmions by spin-polarized currents and external fields.},

In most cases, they are induced by chiral interactions between atomic spins in non-centrosymmetric magnetic compounds or in thin films with broken inversion symmetry. Skyrmions can be extremely small, with diameters in the nanometre range, and behave as particles that can be moved, created and annihilated, which makes them suitable for ‘abacus’-type applications in information storage and logic technologies. Until recently, skyrmions had been observed only at low temperature and, in most cases, under large applied magnetic fields. An intense research effort has led to the identification of thin-film and multilayer structures in which skyrmions are now stable at room temperature and can be manipulated by electrical currents. The development of skyrmion-based topological spintronics holds promise for applications in the mid-term furure, even though many challenges, such as the achievement of writing, processing and reading functionalities at room temperature and in all-electrical manipulation schemes, still lie ahead.},

Lyapunov exponents, which provide a qualitative and quantitative characterization of dynamical behavior, are related to the exponentially fast divergence or convergence of nearby orbits in phase space. A system with one or more positive Lyapunov exponents is defined to be chaotic. Our method is rooted conceptually in a previously developed technique that could only be applied to analytically defined model systems: we monitor the long-term growth rate of small volume elements in an attractor. The method is tested on model systems with known Lyapunov spectra, and applied to data for the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction and Couette-Taylor flow.},

For developing optimal nano-oscillators, accurate simulations of the device's complex behaviour are required before fabrication. This work simulates the key behaviour of a nanoconstriction SHNO as the applied DC bias current is varied. The current density and Oersted field of the device have been presented, the magnetisation oscillations have been clearly visualised in three dimensions and the spatial distribution of the active mode determined. These simulations allow designers a greater understanding and characterisation of the device's behaviour while also providing a means of comparison when experimental resultsO are generated.},

In this work, by studying the spin?orbit torque induced switching in the Heusler alloy Mn2Ru1? x Ga, it is found that efficient current-induced magnetic switching can be realized in a nearly compensated sample with strong perpendicular anisotropy and large film thickness. This work demonstrates the possibility of employing compensated Heusler alloys for fast, energy-efficient spintronic devices.},

  abstract = {Spin-Hall oscillators (SHO) are promising sources of spin-wave signals for magnonics applications, and can serve as building blocks for magnonic logic in ultralow power computation devices. Thin magnetic layers used as “free” layers in SHO are in contact with heavy metals having large spin-orbital interaction, and, therefore, could be subject to the spin-Hall effect (SHE) and the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (i-DMI), which may lead to the nonreciprocity of the excited spin waves and other unusual effects. Here, we analytically and micromagnetically study magnetization dynamics excited in an SHO with oblique magnetization when the SHE and i-DMI act simultaneously. Our key results are: (i) excitation of nonreciprocal spin-waves propagating perpendicularly to the in-plane projection of the static magnetization; (ii) skyrmions generation by pure spin-current; (iii) excitation of a new spin-wave mode with a spiral spatial profile originating from a gyrotropic rotation of a dynamical skyrmion. These results demonstrate that SHOs can be used as generators of magnetic skyrmions and different types of propagating spin-waves for magnetic data storage and signal processing applications.},

It was found that, even without an applied field, the frequency of generated spin waves can reach up to THz range once both Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions and DC current density being reasonably high enough. We have further investigated the origin of THz spectrum. Although the magnetization dynamics of SAF is driven by spin transfer torque (STT) via spin Hall effect (SHE) in heavy metal (HM). The RKKY interactions can obviously boost it by accelerating the wiggle of magnetization in SAF. We also found that the bottom ferromagnetic layer thickness in SAF should be thin and the total thickness of SAF should not exceed the spin diffusion length in order to maximize STT effect and achieve THz spectrum. Finally, we clearly demonstrated the nonreciprocity of generated THz spin wave by introducing interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) at normal metal/ferromagnet (NM/FM) interface. Our results will technically extend the application of spintronic devices into THz field.},

Kajiwara et al. have now developed a hybrid metal-insulator-metal structure in which an electrical signal in one metal layer is directly converted to a spin wave in the insulating layer. This wave is then transmitted to the second metal layer, where the signal can be directly recovered as an electrical voltage. The observation of voltage transmission in an insulator raises the prospect of insulator-based spintronics and other novel forms of signal delivery.},

A prominent example involves self-sustained magnetization oscillations, which are made possible through the compensation of magnetic damping by the transfer of spin angular momentum from a spin-polarized current. In this contribution, the theoretical aspects of magnetization oscillations driven by spin torques, such as spin waves and vortex gyration, are presented in detail and key experimental results are highlighted. It is shown how simple but useful models can be derived from fundamental theories of magnetization dynamics and used to describe a variety of stochastic and nonlinear phenomena.},

  abstract = {The recent discovery that a spin-polarized electrical current can apply a large torque to a ferromagnet, through direct transfer of spin angular momentum, offers the possibility of manipulating magnetic-device elements without applying cumbersome magnetic fields1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. However, a central question remains unresolved: what type of magnetic motions can be generated by this torque? Theory predicts that spin transfer may be able to drive a nanomagnet into types of oscillatory magnetic modes not attainable with magnetic fields alone1,2,3, but existing measurement techniques have provided only indirect evidence for dynamical states4,6,7,8,12,14,15,16. The nature of the possible motions has not been determined. Here we demonstrate a technique that allows direct electrical measurements of microwave-frequency dynamics in individual nanomagnets, propelled by a d.c. spin-polarized current. We show that spin transfer can produce several different types of magnetic excitation. Although there is no mechanical motion, a simple magnetic-multilayer structure acts like a nanoscale motor; it converts energy from a d.c. electrical current into high-frequency magnetic rotations that might be applied in new devices including microwave sources and resonators.},

We report a giant spin Hall effect (SHE) in β-tantalum that generates spin currents intense enough to induce efficient spin-torque switching of ferromagnets at room temperature. We quantify this SHE by three independent methods and demonstrate spin-torque switching of both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetized layers. We furthermore implement a three-terminal device that uses current passing through a tantalum-ferromagnet bilayer to switch a nanomagnet, with a magnetic tunnel junction for read-out. This simple, reliable, and efficient design may eliminate the main obstacles to the development of magnetic memory and nonvolatile spin logic technologies.},

While there is a clear picture of the general principles that underlie the properties of the spin torque nano-oscillator, there are a number of details complicating the picture. We suggest that these details are potentially responsible for adversely affecting uniformity of performance from device to device. These details include (1) nonlinearities, (2) the Oersted field, (3) thermal and deterministic noise sources, and (4) non-uniformity of the spin accumulation. We suggest what role that these details might have in determining spin torque dynamics, and suggest particular avenues of investigation that might clarify whether or not these details are indeed responsible for device variability.

The inverse effect--in which a large electrical current density can perturb the magnetic state of a multilayer--has been predicted2,3,4,5,6,7 and observed experimentally with point contacts8,9 and lithographically patterned samples10,11. Some of these observations were taken as indirect evidence for current-induced excitation of spin waves, or ‘magnons’. Here we probe directly the high-frequency behaviour and partial phase coherence of such current-induced excitations, by externally irradiating a point contact with microwaves. We determine the magnon spectrum and investigate how the magnon frequency and amplitude vary with the exciting current. Our observations support the feasibility of a spin-wave maser2 or ‘SWASER’ (spin-wave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation).},

  abstract = {Ferromagnets are key materials for sensing and memory applications. In contrast, antiferromagnets, which represent the more common form of magnetically ordered materials, have found less practical application beyond their use for establishing reference magnetic orientations via exchange bias. This might change in the future due to the recent progress in materials research and discoveries of antiferromagnetic spintronic phenomena suitable for device applications. Experimental demonstration of the electrical switching and detection of the Néel order open a route towards memory devices based on antiferromagnets. Apart from the radiation and magnetic-field hardness, memory cells fabricated from antiferromagnets can be inherently multilevel, which could be used for neuromorphic computing. Switching speeds attainable in antiferromagnets far exceed those of ferromagnetic and semiconductor memory technologies. Here, we review the recent progress in electronic spin-transport and spin-torque phenomena in antiferromagnets that are dominantly of the relativistic quantum-mechanical origin. We discuss their utility in pure antiferromagnetic or hybrid ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic memory devices.},

  abstract = {The spin-transfer nano-oscillator (STNO) offers the possibility of using the transfer of spin angular momentum via spin-polarized currents to generate microwave signals. However, at present STNO microwave emission mainly relies on both large drive currents and external magnetic fields. These issues hinder the implementation of STNOs for practical applications in terms of power dissipation and size. Here, we report microwave measurements on STNOs built with MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions having a planar polarizer and a perpendicular free layer, where microwave emission with large output power, excited at ultralow current densities and in the absence of any bias magnetic fields is observed. The measured critical current density is over one order of magnitude smaller than previously reported. These results suggest the possibility of improved integration of STNOs with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology and could represent a new route for the development of the next-generation of on-chip oscillators.},

Here, we propose the counterpart of the magnetic skyrmion in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) system, that is, the AFM skyrmion, which is topologically protected but without showing the SkHE. Two approaches for creating the AFM skyrmion have been described based on micromagnetic lattice simulations: (i) by injecting a vertical spin-polarized current to a nanodisk with the AFM ground state; (ii) by converting an AFM domain-wall pair in a nanowire junction. It is demonstrated that the AFM skyrmion, driven by the spin-polarized current, can move straightly over long distance, benefiting from the absence of the SkHE. Our results will open a new strategy on designing the novel spintronic devices based on AFM materials.},

An assumed condition of negligible interfacial reflection for majority-spin electrons is approached by certain multilayer compositions including the experimentally important composition Co/Cu. Analytic formulas based on a non-spin-diagonal density operator inside the spacer connect the spin-channel currents and electro-chemical voltages across the spacer. The quantum-mechanically derived torques on sublayer moments agree with a previous macroscopic relation. The single additional parameter of the resulting macroscopic magnetoelectronic transport formulation depends only on bulk electron structure of the spacer. Illustrative application of the new connection formulas to the special case of two equal thin ferromagnets predicts closely related expressions for angular dependences of magnetoresistance and current-driven torque. A simple relation between magnetoresistance and asymmetry of exciting currents holds for this case.},

  abstract = {Energy-efficient switching of magnetization is a central problem in nonvolatile magnetic storage and magnetic neuromorphic computing. In the past two decades, several efficient methods of magnetic switching were demonstrated including spin torque, magneto-electric, and microwave-assisted switching mechanisms. Here we experimentally show that low-dimensional magnetic chaos induced by alternating spin torque can strongly increase the rate of thermally-activated magnetic switching in a nanoscale ferromagnet. This mechanism exhibits a well-pronounced threshold character in spin torque amplitude and its efficiency increases with decreasing spin torque frequency. We present analytical and numerical calculations that quantitatively explain these experimental findings and reveal the key role played by low-dimensional magnetic chaos near saddle equilibria in enhancement of the switching rate. Our work unveils an important interplay between chaos and stochasticity in the energy assisted switching of magnetic nanosystems and paves the way towards improved energy efficiency of spin torque memory and logic.},

Accordingly, there is a wealth of literature examining the problems from different perspectives (analytical, numerical, experimental etc.), and coverings a wide variety of topics (bifurcations, chaos, strange attractors, imperfection sensitivity, tailor-ability, parametric resonance, conservative or non-conservative systems, linear or non-linear systems, fluid-solid interaction, follower forces, etc.). This paper provides a survey of selected topics of current research interest. It aims to collate the key recent developments and international trends, as well as describe any possible future challenges. A paradigmatic example of Ziegler paradox on the destabilizing effect of small damping is also included.},

  abstract = {A stable skyrmion, representing the smallest realizable magnetic texture, could be an ideal element for ultra-dense magnetic memories. Here, we review recent progress in the field of skyrmionics, which is concerned with studies of tiny whirls of magnetic configurations for novel memory and logic applications, with a particular emphasis on antiskyrmions. Magnetic antiskyrmions represent analogs of skyrmions with opposite topological charge. Just like skyrmions, antiskyrmions can be stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, as has been demonstrated in a recent experiment. Here, we emphasize differences between skyrmions and antiskyrmions, e.g., in the context of the topological Hall effect, skyrmion Hall effect, as well as nucleation and stability. Recent progress suggests that antiskyrmions can be potentially useful for many device applications. Antiskyrmions offer advantages over skyrmions as they can be driven without the Hall-like motion, offer increased stability due to dipolar interactions, and can be realized above room temperature.},

  abstract  = {Topologically ordered materials at certain ranges of temperature and magnetic field can form a regular lattice of magnetic whirls called skyrmions. Milde et al. (p. 1076) studied the destruction of a skyrmion lattice with varying magnetic fields by imaging the surface magnetic structure. Magnetic force microscopy revealed a pairwise merging of skyrmions on the surface. Furthermore, in the bulk, a hedgehog-like spin structure with the properties of the elusive magnetic monopole was needed to "zip" together the corresponding skyrmion lines. Skyrmion crystals are regular arrangements of magnetic whirls that exist in a wide range of chiral magnets. Because of their topology, they cannot be created or destroyed by smooth rearrangements of the direction of the local magnetization. Using magnetic force microscopy, we tracked the destruction of the skyrmion lattice on the surface of a bulk crystal of Fe1-xCoxSi (x = 0.5). Our study revealed that skyrmions vanish by a coalescence, forming elongated structures. Numerical simulations showed that changes of topology are controlled by singular magnetic point defects. They can be viewed as quantized magnetic monopoles and antimonopoles, which provide sources and sinks of one flux quantum of emergent magnetic flux, respectively.},

  abstract = {Skyrmions are stable topological textures with particle-like properties, a mathematical concept originally developed to describe nuclear particles, but which in the past decade has found application at all scales from microscopic to cosmological. Skyrmions have proved particularly useful to describe novel spin configurations in magnets, and last year the presence of skyrmions in the magnetic compounds MnSi and Fe1−xCoxSi was confirmed in neutron scattering experiments. Now Yu et al. present striking real-space images, using transmission electron microscopy, of a two-dimensional skyrmion lattice for the latter compound, in the form of a hexagonal arrangement of swirling spin structures. The lattice is shown to be stable for a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. The authors speculate that the observed nanometre-scale spin topology may lead to interesting new magnetoelectric effects.},

  abstract  = {Magnetic materials hosting correlated electrons play an important role for information technology and signal processing. The currently used ferro-, ferri- and antiferromagnetic materials provide microscopic moments (spins) that are mainly collinear. Recently more complex spin structures such as spin helices and cycloids have regained a lot of interest. The interest has been initiated by the discovery of the skyrmion lattice phase in non-centrosymmetric helical magnets. In this review we address how spin helices and skyrmion lattices enrich the microwave characteristics of magnetic materials and give rise to bottom-up magnonic crystals. When discussing perspectives for microwave electronics and magnonics we focus particularly on insulating materials as they avoid eddy current losses, offer low spin-wave damping, and allow for electric field control. Thereby, they further fuel the vision of magnonics operated at low energy consumption.},

Recent advancements in artificial nanomaterials have demonstrated chiroptical responses that far exceed those found in natural materials. Chiroptical phenomena are complicated processes that involve transitions between states with opposite parities, and solid interpretations of these observations are yet to be clearly provided. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the theoretical aspects of chirality in light, nanostructures, and nanosystems and their chiroptical interactions. Descriptions of observed chiroptical phenomena based on these fundamentals are intensively discussed. We start with the strong intrinsic and extrinsic chirality in plasmonic nanoparticle systems, followed by enantioselective sensing and optical manipulation, and then conclude with orbital angular momentum-dependent responses. This review will be helpful for understanding the mechanisms behind chiroptical phenomena based on underlying chiral properties and useful for interpreting chiroptical systems for further studies.},

This book is a comprehensive survey of static topological solitons and their dynamical interactions. Particular emphasis is placed on the solitons which satisfy first-order Bogomolny equations. For these, the soliton dynamics can be investigated by finding the geodesics on the moduli space of static multi-soliton solutions. Remarkable scattering processes can be understood this way. The book starts with an introduction to classical field theory, and a survey of several mathematical techniques useful for understanding many types of topological soliton. Subsequent chapters explore key examples of solitons in one, two, three and four dimensions. The final chapter discusses the unstable sphaleron solutions which exist in several field theories.},

Here, on the level of micromagnetics we rigorously show that chiral magnets can not only host skyrmions but also antiskyrmions as least energy configurations over all non-trivial homotopy classes. We derive practical criteria for their occurrence and coexistence with skyrmions that can be fulfilled by (110)-oriented interfaces depending on the electronic structure. Relating the electronic structure to an atomistic spin-lattice model by means of density functional calculations and minimizing the energy on a mesoscopic scale by applying spin-relaxation methods, we propose a double layer of Fe grown on a W(110) substrate as a practical example. We conjecture that ultra-thin magnetic films grown on semiconductor or heavy metal substrates with C2vsymmetry are prototype classes of materials hosting magnetic antiskyrmions.},

Three models of the pion-nucleon interaction (and the weak current) are presented that have the required property. The first, using gradient coupling, has the advantage that it is easily generalized to strange particles, but the disadvantages of being unrenormalizable and of bringing in the vector and axial vector currents in an unsymmetrical way. The second model, using a strong interaction proposed bySchwinger and a weak current proposed byPolkinghorne, is renormalizable and symmetrical betweenV andA, but it involves postulating a new particle and is hard to extend to strange particles. The third model resembles the second one except that it is not necessary to introduce a new particle. (Renormalizability in the usual sense is then lost, however). Further research along these lines is suggested, including consideration of the possibility that the pion decay rate may be plausibly obtained under less stringent conditions.},

Recently, skyrmions have been observed to be stabilized by an external magnetic field in bulk magnets. Here, we describe a two-dimensional square lattice of skyrmions on the atomic length scale as the magnetic ground state of a hexagonal Fe film of one-atomic-layer thickness on the Ir(111) surface. Using spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy we can directly image this non-collinear spin texture in real space on the atomic scale and demonstrate that it is incommensurate to the underlying atomic lattice. With the aid of first-principles calculations, we develop a spin model on a discrete lattice that identifies the interplay of Heisenberg exchange, the four-spin and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as the microscopic origin of this magnetic state.},

The compound orders magnetically at TN=278.7 K into a long-range spiral (period approximately 683-700 AA) propagating along equivalent <100> directions at high temperatures and along equivalent <111> directions at low temperatures. The length of the spiral wavevector is nearly independent of temperature. The transition at TN is first order with very little hysteresis. The transition at which the direction of the spiral turns is rather sluggish. It takes place in a temperature interval of approximately 40 K and shows pronounced temperature hysteresis (T2 down arrow =211 K, T2 up arrow =245 K). Applied magnetic fields of 20-40 mT, depending on the temperature and the field direction, cause the spiral axis to turn into the direction of the applied field. As the field is further increased, the amplitude of the antiferromagnetic spiral decreases and the ferromagnetic component increases until at fields above approximately 200-300 mT cubic FeGe becomes magnetically saturated. The magnetic ordering in cubic FeGe is a Dzyaloshinskii spiral similar to the structure observed in the isostructural compound MnSi. However, in MnSi the spiral propagates along equivalent <111> directions at all temperatures below TN=29.5 K.},

Stability of the skyrmions is a critical issue for realising this technology. Here we demonstrate that the racetrack skyrmion lifetime can be calculated from first principles as a function of temperature, magnetic field and track width. Our method combines harmonic transition state theory extended to include Goldstone modes, with an atomistic spin Hamiltonian parametrized from density functional theory calculations. We demonstrate that two annihilation mechanisms contribute to the skyrmion stability: At low external magnetic field, escape through the track boundary prevails, but a crossover field exists, above which the collapse in the interior becomes dominant. Considering a Pd/Fe bilayer on an Ir(111) substrate as a well-established model system, the calculated skyrmion lifetime is found to be consistent with reported experimental measurements. Our simulations also show that the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor of escape depends only weakly on the external magnetic field, whereas the pre-exponential factor for collapse is strongly field dependent. Our results open the door for predictive simulations, free from empirical parameters, to aid the design of skyrmion-based information technology.},

We used Lorentz transmission electron microscopy to infer the energetics associated with the topological decay of magnetic skyrmions far from equilibrium in the chiral magnet Fe1−xCoxSi. We observed that the lifetime τ of the skyrmions depends exponentially on temperature, τ∼τ0 exp(ΔEkBT). The prefactor τ0 of this Arrhenius law changes by more than 30 orders of magnitude for small changes of the magnetic field, reflecting a substantial reduction of the lifetime of skyrmions by entropic effects and, thus, an extreme case of enthalpy-entropy compensation. Such compensation effects, being well known across many different scientific disciplines, affect topological transitions and, thus, topological protection on an unprecedented level.},

However, their stability against thermal fluctuations is an open question that must be answered before skyrmion-based devices can be designed. In this work, we study paths in the energy landscape via which the transition between the skyrmion and the uniform state can occur in interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya finite-sized systems. We find three mechanisms the system can take in the process of skyrmion nucleation or destruction and identify that the transition facilitated by the boundary has a significantly lower energy barrier than the other energy paths. This clearly demonstrates the lack of the skyrmion topological protection in finite-sized magnetic systems. Overall, the energy barriers of the system under investigation are too small for storage applications at room temperature, but research into device materials, geometry and design may be able to address this.},

Materials with this crystal structure lack inversion symmetry; they have chirality and are capable of supporting a long range static spin density wave at low temperature. Various aspects of the magnetic phase diagrams of FeGe and MnSi have been studied by small-angle neutron scattering and correlated to the most recent theoretical treatments. Detailed magnetization studies of both compounds have led to a re-analysis of some of the neutron diffraction data for FeGe and an extended study of MnSi, in particular of the magnetic structure in the so-called ?phase-A? near the critical temperature. For both compounds, the data are consistent with the Landau-type free energy calculations for the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya helices. The new data for MnSi indicate that the anisotropy energy, which governs the direction of helix propagation, changes sign when passing through ?phase-A?.},

Skyrmions have been observed experimentally, but manipulating them individually remains a challenge. Romming et al. (p. 636; see the cover) used spin-polarized electrons generated by a scanning tunneling microscope to reversibly create and destroy skyrmions in a thin iron film covered by a layer of palladium. The energy of the tunneling electrons was the decisive factor determining the probability of the process; atomic defects in the film acted as pinning sites for the skyrmions. The work demonstrates the feasibility of using spin-polarized tunnel currents for the controlled manipulation of individual skyrmions. Topologically nontrivial spin textures have recently been investigated for spintronic applications. Here, we report on an ultrathin magnetic film in which individual skyrmions can be written and deleted in a controlled fashion with local spin-polarized currents from a scanning tunneling microscope. An external magnetic field is used to tune the energy landscape, and the temperature is adjusted to prevent thermally activated switching between topologically distinct states. Switching rate and direction can then be controlled by the parameters used for current injection. The creation and annihilation of individual magnetic skyrmions demonstrates the potential for topological charge in future information-storage concepts.},

To realize skyrmion-based spintronic devices, it is essential to understand skyrmion motions in confined geometries. Here we show by micromagnetic simulations that the current-induced motion of skyrmions in the presence of geometrical boundaries is very different from that in an infinite plane. In a channel of finite width, transverse confinement results in steady-state characteristics of the skyrmion velocity as a function of current that are similar to those of domain walls in ferromagnets, whereas the transient behaviour depends on the initial distance of the skyrmion from the boundary. Furthermore, we show that a single skyrmion can be created by an electric current in a simple constricted geometry comprising a plate-shaped specimen of suitable size and geometry. These findings could guide the design of skyrmion-based devices in which skyrmions are used as information carriers.},

  abstract = {The emergence of a topologically nontrivial vortex-like magnetic structure, the magnetic skyrmion, has launched new concepts for memory devices. Extensive studies have theoretically demonstrated the ability to encode information bits by using a chain of skyrmions in one-dimensional nanostripes. Here, we report experimental observation of the skyrmion chain in FeGe nanostripes by using high-resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Under an applied magnetic field, we observe that the helical ground states with distorted edge spins evolve into individual skyrmions, which assemble in the form of a chain at low field and move collectively into the interior of the nanostripes at elevated fields. Such a skyrmion chain survives even when the width of the nanostripe is much larger than the size of single skyrmion. This discovery demonstrates a way of skyrmion formation through the edge effect, and might, in the long term, shed light on potential applications.},

We show that in the field-polarized (FP) ferromagnetic phase magnon states exist which are bound to the edge, and we calculate their spectra within a continuum field theory. Upon lowering an external magnetic field, these bound magnons condense at a finite momentum and the edge becomes locally unstable. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that this edge instability triggers the creation of a helical phase which penetrates the FP state within the bulk. A subsequent increase of the magnetic field allows to create skyrmions close to the edge in a controlled manner.},

  abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions, topological solitons characterized by a two-dimensional swirling spin texture, have recently attracted attention as stable particle-like objects. In a three-dimensional system, a skyrmion can extend in the third dimension forming a robust and flexible string structure, whose unique topology and symmetry are anticipated to host nontrivial functional responses. Here we experimentally demonstrate the coherent propagation of spin excitations along skyrmion strings for the chiral-lattice magnet Cu2OSeO3. We find that this propagation is directionally non-reciprocal and the degree of non-reciprocity, as well as group velocity and decay length, are strongly dependent on the character of the excitation modes. These spin excitations can propagate over a distance exceeding 50 μm, demonstrating the excellent long-range ordered nature of the skyrmion-string structure. Our combined experimental and theoretical analyses offer a comprehensive account of the propagation dynamics of skyrmion-string excitations and suggest the possibility of unidirectional information transfer along such topologically protected strings.},

  abstract = {An inductor, one of the most fundamental circuit elements in modern electronic devices, generates a voltage proportional to the time derivative of the input current1. Conventional inductors typically consist of a helical coil and induce a voltage as a counteraction to time-varying magnetic flux penetrating the coil, following Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. The magnitude of this conventional inductance is proportional to the volume of the inductor’s coil, which hinders the miniaturization of inductors2. Here, we demonstrate an inductance of quantum-mechanical origin3, generated by the emergent electric field induced by current-driven dynamics of spin helices in a magnet. In microscale rectangular magnetic devices with nanoscale spin helices, we observe a typical inductance as large as −400 nanohenry, comparable in magnitude to that of a commercial inductor, but in a volume about a million times smaller. The observed inductance is enhanced by nonlinearity in current and shows non-monotonous frequency dependence, both of which result from the current-driven dynamics of the spin-helix structures. The magnitude of the inductance rapidly increases with decreasing device cross-section, in contrast to conventional inductors. Our findings may pave the way to microscale, simple-shaped inductors based on emergent electromagnetism related to the quantum-mechanical Berry phase.},

  abstract = {The well-known Hall effect describes the transverse deflection of charged particles (electrons/holes) as a result of the Lorentz force. Similarly, it is intriguing to examine if quasi-particles without an electric charge, but with a topological charge, show related transverse motion. Magnetic skyrmions with a well-defined spin texture with a unit topological charge serve as good candidates to test this hypothesis. In spite of the recent progress made on investigating magnetic skyrmions, direct observation of the skyrmion Hall effect has remained elusive. Here, by using a current-induced spin Hall spin torque, we experimentally demonstrate the skyrmion Hall effect, and the resultant skyrmion accumulation, by driving skyrmions from the creep-motion regime (where their dynamics are influenced by pinning defects) into the steady-flow-motion regime. The experimental observation of transverse transport of skyrmions due to topological charge may potentially create many exciting opportunities, such as topological selection.},

  abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions are promising candidates for future spintronic applications such as skyrmion racetrack memories and logic devices. They exhibit exotic and complex dynamics governed by topology and are less influenced by defects, such as edge roughness, than conventionally used domain walls. In particular, their non-zero topological charge leads to a predicted ‘skyrmion Hall effect’, in which current-driven skyrmions acquire a transverse velocity component analogous to charged particles in the conventional Hall effect. Here, we use nanoscale pump-probe imaging to reveal the real-time dynamics of skyrmions driven by current-induced spin-orbit torques. We find that skyrmions move at a well-defined angle ΘSkH that can exceed 30° with respect to the current flow, but in contrast to conventional theoretical expectations, ΘSkH increases linearly with velocity up to at least 100 ms−1. We qualitatively explain our observation based on internal mode excitations in combination with a field-like spin-orbit torque, showing that one must go beyond the usual rigid skyrmion description to understand the dynamics.},

The skyrmions recently discovered in chiral magnets have much smaller critical current density of ~105-106 A m−2, but the microscopic mechanism is not yet explored. Here we present a numerical simulation of Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, which reveals a remarkably robust and universal current-velocity relation of the skyrmion motion driven by the spin-transfer-torque unaffected by either impurities or nonadiabatic effect in sharp contrast to the case of domain wall or spin helix. Simulation results are analysed using a theory based on Thiele’s equation, and it is concluded that this behaviour is due to the Magnus force and flexible shape-deformation of individual skyrmions and skyrmion crystal, which enable them to avoid pinning centres.},

  abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions are topologically stable spin configurations, which usually originate from chiral interactions known as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Skyrmion lattices were initially observed in bulk non-centrosymmetric crystals, but have more recently been noted in ultrathin films, where their existence is explained by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions induced by the proximity to an adjacent layer with strong spin-orbit coupling. Skyrmions are promising candidates as information carriers for future information-processing devices due to their small size (down to a few nanometres) and to the very small current densities needed to displace skyrmion lattices. However, any practical application will probably require the creation, manipulation and detection of isolated skyrmions in magnetic thin-film nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate by numerical investigations that an isolated skyrmion can be a stable configuration in a nanostructure, can be locally nucleated by injection of spin-polarized current, and can be displaced by current-induced spin torques, even in the presence of large defects.},

We show that a nano-second current pulse alone is capable of creating/deleting and manipulating skyrmions in a spin valve with a perpendicularly magnetized free layer and broken chiral symmetry. Interestingly, for an in-plane magnetized fixed layer, the free layer changes from a single domain at zero current to a Neel wall at an intermediate current density. Reverse the current polarity, the Neel wall changes to its image inversion. A properly designed nano-second current pulse, that tends to convert one type of Neel walls to its image inversion, ends up to create a stable skyrmion without assistance of external fields.

  abstract = {Non-collinear and non-coplanar spin textures, such as chiral domain walls1 and helical or triangular spin structures2,3, bring about diverse functionalities. Among them, magnetic skyrmions, particle-like non-coplanar topological spin structures characterized by a non-zero integer topological charge called the skyrmion number (Nsk), have great potential for various spintronic applications, such as energy-saving, non-volatile memory and non-von Neumann devices4-7. Current pulses can initiate skyrmion creation in thin-film samples8-10 but require relatively large current densities, which probably causes Joule heating. Moreover, skyrmion creation is localized at a specific position in the film depending on the sample design. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an approach to skyrmion creation employing surface acoustic waves (SAWs); in asymmetric multilayers of Pt/Co/Ir, propagating SAWs induce skyrmions in a wide area of the magnetic film. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that inhomogeneous torque arising from both SAWs and thermal fluctuations creates magnetic textures, with pair structures consisting of a Néel skyrmion-like and an antiskyrmion-like structure. Subsequently, such pairs transform to a Néel skyrmion due to the instability of the antiskyrmion-like structure in a system with interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our findings provide a tool for efficient manipulation of topological spin objects without heat dissipation and over large areas, given that the propagation length of SAWs is of the order of millimetres.},

  abstract  = {Early experiments in magnonics were made using ferrite samples, largely due to the intrinsically low magnetic (spin-wave) damping in these materials. Historically, magnonic phenomena were studied on micrometre to millimetre length scales. Today, the principal challenge in applied magnonics is to create sub-micrometre devices using modern polycrystalline magnetic alloys. However, until certain technical obstacles are overcome in these materials, ferrites--in particular yttrium iron garnet (YIG)--remain a valuable source of insight. At a time when interest in magnonic systems is particularly strong, it is both useful and timely to review the main scientific results of YIG magnonics of the last two decades, and to discuss the transferability of the concepts and ideas learned in ferrite materials to modern nano-scale systems.},

  abstract = {Wave control in the solid state has opened new avenues in modern information technology. Surface-acoustic-wave-based devices are found as mass market products in 100 millions of cellular phones. Spin waves (magnons) would offer a boost in today's data handling and security implementations, i.e., image processing and speech recognition. However, nanomagnonic devices realized so far suffer from the relatively short damping length in the metallic ferromagnets amounting to a few 10 micrometers typically. Here we demonstrate that nm-thick YIG films overcome the damping chasm. Using a conventional coplanar waveguide we excite a large series of short-wavelength spin waves (SWs). From the data we estimate a macroscopic of damping length of about 600 micrometers. The intrinsic damping parameter suggests even a record value about 1 mm allowing for magnonics-based nanotechnology with ultra-low damping. In addition, SWs at large wave vector are found to exhibit the non-reciprocal properties relevant for new concepts in nanoscale SW-based logics. We expect our results to provide the basis for coherent data processing with SWs at GHz rates and in large arrays of cellular magnetic arrays, thereby boosting the envisioned image processing and speech recognition.},

However, magnetic nanodevices will enable smart GHz-to-THz devices at low power consumption only, if such spin waves (magnons) are generated and manipulated on the sub-100 nm scale. Here we show how magnons with a wavelength of a few 10 nm are exploited by combining the functionality of insulating yttrium iron garnet and nanodisks from different ferromagnets. We demonstrate magnonic devices at wavelengths of 88 nm written/read by conventional coplanar waveguides. Our microwave-to-magnon transducers are reconfigurable and thereby provide additional functionalities. The results pave the way for a multi-functional GHz technology with unprecedented miniaturization exploiting nanoscale wavelengths that are otherwise relevant for soft X-rays. Nanomagnonics integrated with broadband microwave circuitry offer applications that are wide ranging, from nanoscale microwave components to nonlinear data processing, image reconstruction and wave-based logic.},

We demonstrate that the gradients of inhomogeneous static magnetic fields can lead to the effective generation of short-wavelength dipole-exchange waves having non-resonant spatial distribution.

One such candidate is the magnon: the quasiparticle associated with the eigen-excitations of magnetic materials known as spin waves. The realization of single-chip all-magnon information systems demands the development of circuits in which magnon currents can be manipulated by magnons themselves. Using a magnonic crystal--an artificial magnetic material--to enhance nonlinear magnon-magnon interactions, we have succeeded in the realization of magnon-by-magnon control, and the development of a magnon transistor. We present a proof of concept three-terminal device fabricated from an electrically insulating magnetic material.

  abstract = {Novel material properties can be realized by designing waves’ dispersion relations in artificial crystals. The crystal’s structural length scales may range from nano- (light) up to centimeters (sound waves). Because of their emergent properties these materials are called metamaterials. Different to photonics, where the dielectric constant dominantly determines the index of refraction, in a ferromagnet the spin-wave index of refraction can be dramatically changed already by the magnetization direction. This allows a different flexibility in realizing dynamic wave guides or spin-wave switches. The present review will give an introduction into the novel functionalities of spin-wave devices, concepts for spin-wave based computing and magnonic crystals. The parameters of the magnetic metamaterials are adjusted to the spin-wave k-vector such that the magnonic band structure is designed. However, already the elementary building block of an antidot lattice, the singular hole, owns a strongly varying internal potential determined by its magnetic dipole field and a localization of spin-wave modes. Photo-magnonics reveal a way to investigate the control over the interplay between localization and delocalization of the spin-wave modes using femtosecond lasers, which is a major focus of this review. We will discuss the crucial parameters to realize free Bloch states and how, by contrast, a controlled localization might allow us to gradually turn on and manipulate spin-wave interactions in spin-wave based devices in the future.},

We describe possible schemes for general computing and special task data processing. The functional throughput of the magnonic logic gates is estimated and compared with the conventional transistor-based approach. Magnonic logic circuits allow scaling down to the deep submicrometre range and THz frequency operation.

Corresponding experimental and theoretical work in magnonics faces significant challenges in that spin-wave dispersion relations are highly anisotropic and different magnetic states might be realized via, for example, the magnetic field history. At the same time, these features offer novel opportunities for wave control in solids going beyond photonics and plasmonics. In this topical review we address materials with a periodic modulation of magnetic parameters that give rise to artificially tailored band structures and allow unprecedented control of spin waves. In particular, we discuss recent achievements and perspectives of reconfigurable magnonic devices for which band structures can be reprogrammed during operation. Such characteristics might be useful for multifunctional microwave and logic devices operating over a broad frequency regime on either the macro- or nanoscale.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a rapidly growing interest in exploring the use of spin waves for information transmission and computation toward establishing a spin-wave-based technology that is not only significantly more energy efficient than the CMOS technology, but may also cause a major departure from the von-Neumann architecture by enabling memory-in-logic and logic-in-memory architectures. A major bottleneck of advancing this technology is the excitation of spin waves with short wavelengths, which is a must because the wavelength dictates device scalability. Here, we report the discovery of an approach for the excitation of nm-wavelength spin waves. The demonstration uses ferromagnetic nanowires grown on a 20-nm-thick Y3Fe5O12 film strip. The propagation of spin waves with a wavelength down to 50 nm over a distance of 60,000 nm is measured. The measurements yield a spin-wave group velocity as high as 2600 m s−1, which is faster than both domain wall and skyrmion motions.},

Such devices utilise the spin degree of freedom of electrons and/or holes, which can also interact with their orbital moments. In these devices, the spin polarisation is controlled either by magnetic layers used as spin-polarisers or analysers or via spin–orbit coupling. Spin waves can also be used to carry spin current. In this review, the fundamental physics of these phenomena is described first with respect to the spin generation methods as detailed in Sections 2 ~ 9. The recent development in their device applications then follows in Sections 10 and 11. Future perspectives are provided at the end.},

Similar behaviour is anticipated for the lattice forms of topological spin textures, such as lattices composed of merons and antimerons or skyrmions and antiskyrmions (types of vortex related to the distribution of electron spins in a magnetic field), but has yet to be verified experimentally2,3. Here we report real-space observations of spin textures in a thin plate of the chiral-lattice magnet Co8Zn9Mn3, which exhibits in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The observations demonstrate the emergence of a two-dimensional square lattice of merons and antimerons from a helical state, and its transformation into a hexagonal lattice of skyrmions in the presence of a magnetic field at room temperature. Sequential observations with decreasing temperature reveal that the topologically protected skyrmions remain robust to changes in temperature, whereas the square lattice of merons and antimerons relaxes to non-topological in-plane spin helices, highlighting the different topological stabilities of merons, antimerons and skyrmions. Our results demonstrate the rich variety of topological spin textures and their lattice forms, and should stimulate further investigation of emergent electromagnetic properties.},

  abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions have attracted enormous research interest since their discovery a decade ago. The non-trivial real-space topology of these nano-whirls leads to fundamentally interesting and technologically relevant consequences -- the skyrmion Hall effect of the texture and the topological Hall effect of the electrons. Furthermore, it grants skyrmions in a ferromagnetic surrounding great stability even at small sizes, making skyrmions aspirants to become the carriers of information in the future. Still, the utilization of skyrmions in spintronic devices has not been achieved yet, among other reasons, due to shortcomings in their current-driven motion. In this review, we present recent trends in the field of topological spin textures that go beyond skyrmions. The majority of these objects can be considered a combination of multiple subparticles, such as the bimeron, or the skyrmion analogues in different magnetic surroundings, such as antiferromagnetic skyrmions, as well as three-dimensional generalizations, such as hopfions. We classify the alternative magnetic quasiparticles - some of them observed experimentally, others theoretical predictions - and present the most relevant and auspicious advantages of this emerging field.},

  abstract = {Many prominent phenomena originate from geometrical effects rather than from local physics. For example, the 'hairy ball' (HB) theorem asserts that a hairy sphere cannot be combed without introducing at least one singularity, and is fulfilled by the atmospheric circulation with the existence of stratospheric polar vortices and the fact that there is always at least one place on Earth where the horizontal wind is still. In this study, we examine the consequences of the HB theorem for the lattice of flux lines that form when a magnetic field is applied to a type-II superconducting crystal. We find that discontinuities must exist in lattice shape as a function of field direction relative to the crystal. Extraordinary, 'unconventional' flux line lattice shapes that spontaneously break the underlying crystal symmetry are thus remarkably likely across all type-II superconductors, both conventional and unconventional.},

  abstract  = {We investigate the magnonic band structure of in-plane magnetized two-dimensional magnonic crystals composed of cobalt dots embedded into a permalloy antidot lattice. Our analysis is based on the results of numerical calculations carried out by the plane wave method. The complex magnonic band structure found in square-lattice magnonic crystals is explained on the basis of the spin wave dispersion relations calculated in the empty lattice model. We show that four principal effects influence the formation of a magnonic band structure in planar two-dimensional bi-component magnonic crystals: a folding effect, Bragg scattering, hybridization between various spin wave modes, and a demagnetizing field. While the first two effects are found for other types of waves in periodic composites, the third one exists in an anisotropic medium and the last one is specific to spin waves propagating in magnonic crystals with magnetization in the film plane. The strong anisotropy in the dispersion relation of spin waves in thin ferromagnetic films results in the crossing and anti-crossing of the fast, Damon-Eshbach-like mode with a number of other spin waves folded to the first Brillouin zone. The demagnetizing field can induce the formation of channels for spin waves which are propagating perpendicular to the external magnetic field direction, but this property exists only in the limiting range of the thicknesses and the lattice constants of the bi-component magnonic crystals. Based on the model analysis we propose a modification of the magnonic crystal structure by changing its thickness, lattice constant and aspect ratio along the direction of the applied magnetic field to significantly modify the magnonic band structure and obtain partial magnonic band gaps.},

  abstract     = {While spin waves in conventional ferromagnets are well understood, those in more complicated magnets hosting spatially textured magnetization, such as helical/conical and skyrmion/hedgehog configurations, are less explored. We investigate experimentally and theoretically the spin waves of the conical spin helix in a chiral magnet with the help of Brillouin light scattering. We discovered that the dynamics of the conical spin helix is characterized by a distinct nonreciprocity with spin waves preferentially propagating in a specific direction controlled by the orientation of the magnetic field. Our work therefore demonstrates that all the spin phases of bulk chiral magnets allow, in principle, the realization of a switchable spin wave diode functionality.Nonreciprocity emerges in nature and in artificial objects from various physical origins, being widely utilized in contemporary technologies as exemplified by diode elements in electronics. While most of the nonreciprocal phenomena are realized by employing interfaces where the inversion symmetry is trivially lifted, nonreciprocal transport of photons, electrons, magnons, and possibly phonons also emerge in bulk crystals with broken space inversion and time reversal symmetries. Among them, directional propagation of bulk magnons (i.e., quanta of spin wave excitation) is attracting much attention nowadays for its potentially large nonreciprocity suitable for spintronic and spin-caloritronic applications. Here, we demonstrate nonreciprocal propagation of spin waves for the conical spin helix state in Cu2OSeO3 due to a combination of dipole and Dzyaloshinskii{\textendash}Moriya interactions. The observed nonreciprocal spin dispersion smoothly connects to the hitherto known magnetochiral nonreciprocity in the field-induced collinear spin state; thus, all the spin phases show diode characteristics in this chiral insulator.All study data are included in the article and/or SI Appendix.},

The chiral-lattice multiferroic Cu2OSeO3 became the first insulating helimagnetic material in which a long-range order of topologically stable spin vortices known as skyrmions was established. Here we employ state-of-the-art inelastic neutron scattering to comprehend the full three-dimensional spin-excitation spectrum of Cu2OSeO3 over a broad range of energies. Distinct types of high- and low-energy dispersive magnon modes separated by an extensive energy gap are observed in excellent agreement with the previously suggested microscopic theory based on a model of entangled Cu4 tetrahedra. The comparison of our neutron spectroscopy data with model spin-dynamical calculations based on these theoretical proposals enables an accurate quantitative verification of the fundamental magnetic interactions in Cu2OSeO3 that are essential for understanding its abundant low-temperature magnetically ordered phases.},

  abstract = {Linear dichroism -- the polarization dependent absorption of electromagnetic waves-- is routinely exploited in applications as diverse as structure determination of DNA or polarization filters in optical technologies. Here filamentary absorbers with a large length-to-width ratio are a prerequisite. For magnetization dynamics in the few GHz frequency regime strictly linear dichroism was not observed for more than eight decades. Here, we show that the bulk chiral magnet Cu2OSeO3 exhibits linearly polarized magnetization dynamics at an unexpectedly small frequency of about 2 GHz at zero magnetic field. Unlike optical filters that are assembled from filamentary absorbers, the magnet is shown to provide linear polarization as a bulk material for an extremely wide range of length-to-width ratios. In addition, the polarization plane of a given mode can be switched by 90° via a small variation in width. Our findings shed a new light on magnetization dynamics in that ferrimagnetic ordering combined with antisymmetric exchange interaction offers strictly linear polarization and cross-polarized modes for a broad spectrum of sample shapes at zero field. The discovery allows for novel design rules and optimization of microwave-to-magnon transduction in emerging microwave technologies.},

Although non-chiral but polar crystals with Cnv symmetry were identified as ideal SkL hosts in pioneering theoretical studies, this archetype of SkL has remained experimentally unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of a SkL in the polar magnetic semiconductor GaV4S8 with rhombohedral (C3v) symmetry and easy axis anisotropy. The SkL exists over an unusually broad temperature range compared with other bulk crystals and the orientation of the vortices is not controlled by the external magnetic field, but instead confined to the magnetic easy axis. Supporting theory attributes these unique features to a new Néel-type of SkL describable as a superposition of spin cycloids in contrast to the Bloch-type SkL in chiral magnets described in terms of spin helices.},

  abstract = {Antiferromagnets are promising for future spintronic applications owing to their advantageous properties: They are magnetically ordered, but neighboring magnetic moments point in opposite directions, which results in zero net magnetization. This means antiferromagnets produce no stray fields and are insensitive to external magnetic field perturbations. Furthermore, they show intrinsic high frequency dynamics, exhibit considerable spin-orbit and magneto-transport effects. Over the past decade, it has been realized that antiferromagnets have more to offer than just being utilized as passive components in exchange bias applications. This development resulted in a paradigm shift, which opens the pathway to novel concepts using antiferromagnets for spin-based technologies and applications. This article gives a broad perspective on antiferromagnetic spintronics. In particular, the manipulation and detection of antiferromagnetic states by spintronics effects, as well as spin transport and dynamics in antiferromagnetic materials will be discussed. We will also outline current challenges and future research directions in this emerging field.},

Despite recent progress, ferromagnetic order generates dipolar fields that prevent ultrasmall skyrmion sizes, and allows a transverse deflection of moving skyrmions that hinders their efficient manipulation. Antiferromagnetic skyrmions shall lift these limitations. Here we demonstrate that room-temperature antiferromagnetic skyrmions can be stabilized in synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs), in which perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, antiferromagnetic coupling and chiral order can be adjusted concurrently. Utilizing interlayer electronic coupling to an adjacent bias layer, we demonstrate that spin-spiral states obtained in a SAF with vanishing perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be turned into isolated antiferromagnetic skyrmions. We also provide model-based estimates of skyrmion size and stability, showing that room-temperature antiferromagnetic skyrmions below 10 nm in radius can be anticipated in further optimized SAFs. Antiferromagnetic skyrmions in SAFs may thus solve major issues associated with ferromagnetic skyrmions for low-power spintronic devices.},

  abstract = {The current-driven magnetization dynamics in spin torque oscillators is investigated because of its high potential for high-frequency applications. The system consists of a pinned layer with a fixed magnetization and a single-domain free layer, such that it is governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation. In particular, we study the effect of a time-dependent quasi-periodic current. We numerically characterize the dynamical behavior of the system by monitoring the Lyapunov exponents, and by calculating the Fourier spectra. We find a rather complicated landscape of sometimes closely intermingled chaotic and non-chaotic areas in the parameters space. Finally, we compute a phase diagram of the existence of the strange non-chaotic attractors.},

Recently, it has been found that spin current can also be mediated by spin-triplet supercurrent, superconducting quasiparticles, spinons, magnons, spin superfluidity and so on. Here, we review key progress concerning the developing research direction utilizing spin current as a probe of quantum materials. We focus on spin-triplet superconductivity and spin dynamics in the ferromagnet/superconductor heterostructures, quantum spin liquids, magnetic phase transitions, magnon-polarons, magnon-polaritons, magnon Bose-Einstein condensates and spin superfluidity. The unique characteristics of spin current as a probe will be fruitful for future investigation of spin-dependent properties and the identification of new quantum materials.},

  abstract = {The spontaneous magnetic orders arising in ferro-, ferri- and antiferromagnets stem from various magnetic interactions. Depending on the interplay and competition among the Heisenberg exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya exchange interaction, magnetic dipolar interaction and crystal anisotropies, a great variety of magnetic textures may be stabilized, such as magnetic domain walls, vortices, Skyrmions and spiral helical structures. While each of these spin textures responds to external forces in a specific manner with characteristic resonance frequencies, they also interact with magnons, the fundamental collective excitation of the magnetic order, which can propagate in magnetic materials free of charge transport and therefore with low energy dissipation. Recent theories and experiments found that the interplay between spin waves and magnetic textures is particularly interesting and rich in physics. In this review, we introduce and discuss the theoretical framework of magnons living on a magnetic texture background, as well as recent experimental progress in the manipulation of magnons via magnetic textures. The flexibility and reconfigurability of magnetic textures are discussed regarding the potential for applications in information processing schemes based on magnons.},

So far attention has focused on skyrmions stabilized either by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) or by dipolar interaction, where in the latter case the excitations are known as bubble skyrmions. Here we demonstrate the existence of a dynamically stabilized skyrmion, which exists even when dipolar interactions and DMI are absent. We establish how such dynamic skyrmions can be nucleated, sustained and manipulated in an effectively lossless medium under a nanocontact. As quasiparticles, they can be transported between two nanocontacts in a nanowire, even in complete absence of DMI. Conversely, in the presence of DMI, we observe that the dynamical skyrmion experiences strong breathing. All of this points towards a wide range of skyrmion manipulation, which can be studied in a much wider class of materials than considered so far.},

Skyrmionics is an attempt to use magnetic skyrmions as information carriers in next generation spintronic devices. Proposals of manipulations and operations of skyrmions are highly desired. Here, we show that the conversion, duplication and merging of isolated skyrmions with different chirality and topology are possible all in one system. We also demonstrate the conversion of a skyrmion into another form of a skyrmion, i.e., a bimeron. We design spin logic gates such as the AND and OR gates based on manipulations of skyrmions.

For application purposes, they are expected to be nano-sized, to have broad working frequency, narrow spectral linewidth, high output power and low power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate by micromagnetic simulation that magnetic skyrmions, topologically stable nanoscale magnetization configurations, can be excited into oscillation by a spin-polarized current. Thus, we propose a new kind of STNO using magnetic skyrmions. It is found that the working frequency of this oscillator can range from nearly 0 Hz to gigahertz. The linewidth can be smaller than 1 MHz. Furthermore, this device can work at a current density magnitude as small as 108 A m−2, and it is also expected to improve the output power. Our studies may contribute to the development of skyrmion-based microwave generators.},

For regular states the local average probability density Pi rises to large values on caustics at the boundaries of the classically allowed region in coordinate space, and psi exhibits strong anisotropic interference oscillations. For irregular states Pi falls to zero (or in two dimensions stays constant) on 'anticaustics' at the boundary of the classically allowed region, and psi appears to be a Gaussian random function exhibiting more moderate interference oscillations which for ergodic classical motion are statistically isotropic with the autocorrelation of psi given by a Bessel function.},

  abstract = {In the quest for post-CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) technologies, driven by the need for improved efficiency and performance, topologically protected ferromagnetic ‘whirls’ such as skyrmions1-8 and their anti-particles have shown great promise as solitonic information carriers in racetrack memory-in-logic or neuromorphic devices1,9-11. However, the presence of dipolar fields in ferromagnets, which restricts the formation of ultrasmall topological textures3,6,8,9,12, and the deleterious skyrmion Hall effect, when skyrmions are driven by spin torques9,10,12, have thus far inhibited their practical implementation. Antiferromagnetic analogues, which are predicted to demonstrate relativistic dynamics, fast deflection-free motion and size scaling, have recently become the subject of intense focus9,13-19, but they have yet to be experimentally demonstrated in natural antiferromagnetic systems. Here we realize a family of topological antiferromagnetic spin textures in α-Fe2O3--an Earth-abundant oxide insulator--capped with a platinum overlayer. By exploiting a first-order analogue of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism20,21, we stabilize exotic merons and antimerons (half-skyrmions)8 and their pairs (bimerons)16,22, which can be erased by magnetic fields and regenerated by temperature cycling. These structures have characteristic sizes of the order of 100 nanometres and can be chemically controlled via precise tuning of the exchange and anisotropy, with pathways through which further scaling may be achieved. Driven by current-based spin torques from the heavy-metal overlayer, some of these antiferromagnetic textures could emerge as prime candidates for low-energy antiferromagnetic spintronics at room temperature1,9-11,23.},

  abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions are topological solitons with a nanoscale winding spin texture that hold promise for spintronics applications1-4. Skyrmions have so far been observed in a variety of magnets that exhibit nearly parallel alignment for neighbouring spins, but theoretically skyrmions with anti-parallel neighbouring spins are also possible. Such antiferromagnetic skyrmions may allow more flexible control than conventional ferromagnetic skyrmions5-10. Here, by combining neutron scattering measurements and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that a fractional antiferromagnetic skyrmion lattice is stabilized in MnSc2S4 through anisotropic couplings. The observed lattice is composed of three antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices, and each sublattice is a triangular skyrmion lattice that is fractionalized into two parts with an incipient meron (half-skyrmion) character11,12. Our work demonstrates that the theoretically proposed antiferromagnetic skyrmions can be stabilized in real materials and represents an important step towards their implementation in spintronic devices.},
